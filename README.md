Waste Estimation Support Tool: GIS Add-in

About: This ArcGIS script was developed to support the geospatial functions necessary to develop a WEST GIS scenario.

Waste Estimation Support Tool (WEST): estimates waste generated from remediation and cleanup activities following a radiological incident. WEST can be used to evaluate customized cleanup strategies that allow end-users to evaluate different means of decontamination and how those strategies may impact the resulting waste stream in each geographical locality
